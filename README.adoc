This package implements Asciidoc language support for the
link:https://codemirror.net/6/[CodeMirror] code editor.
This is currently a work in progress as it relies on
link:https://github.com/b177y/lezer-asciidoc[lezer-asciidoc]
which is under development.

The link:https://codemirror.net/6/[project page] has more information, a
number of link:https://codemirror.net/6/examples/[examples] and the
link:https://codemirror.net/6/docs/.[documentation]

This code is released under an
link:https://github.com/b177y/codemirror-lang-asciidoc/tree/main/LICENSE[MIT license].

We aim to be an inclusive, welcoming community. To make that explicit,
we have a
